### C++ Pointer Task

Write a C++ program that dynamically allocates an array of integers using pointers. Create a function that takes a pointer to the array and its size, fills the array with values, and then prints the values. Finally, remember to deallocate the memory.

### GO Pointer Task

Create a Go program that defines a slice of integers. Write a function that takes a pointer to the slice, modifies the elements by doubling their values, and then prints the updated slice. Ensure to demonstrate how pointers work with slices in Go.
